#  Fun with Grand Central Dispatch

This project is a showcase for most concepts and tasks, that we can perfrom using Grand Central Dispatch. I have prepared being an iOS Expert for [iOS Ukraine conference #1](https://www.facebook.com/events/316585402972291), that took place in September 2020.

It consists of a series of tasks, from basic to more complex, that illustrate how something works or how a certain problem is usually solved.

## How to use it
Open ViewController.swift and uncomment a task you are interested in. Run!

### Task 0
Illustrates how synchronous execution works

### Task 1
Illustrates how asynchronous execution works

### Task 2
Illustrates how concurrent and serial queues work

### Task 3
Illustrates how the system handles queues with different quality of service

### Task 4
Illustrates how the system handles queues with different quality of service and main queue

### Task 5
Illustrates how the system handles queues with different quality of service

### Task 6
Illustrates concurrent access to a property and a proper way to protect a property

### Task 7
Illustrates how concurrent execution of a not protected section of code can crash an app in a place where everything looks safe

### Task 8
Illustrates how to synchronize asyn API

### Task 9
Shows how to create own very simple asynchronous interface

### Task 10
Shows how to create an asynchronous interface in a way, that is used extnsively in Apple products

### Task 11
Know how to deadlock (so you won't)

### Task 12
Illustrates how to execute a completion after several asynchronous tasks are finished (like updating UI after getting responses on several API requests)

## Further Reading
There is an excellent book on GCD: 'Pro Multythreading and Memory Management for iOS and OSX with ARC, Grand Central Dispatch and Blocks' by Kazuki Sakamoto and Tomohiko Furumoto.
